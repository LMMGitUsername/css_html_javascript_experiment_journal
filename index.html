  <h1> This is an experiment to aid in my html learnin'. </h1>
  <p> I am practicing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by going through a list of HTML tags to create the HTML skeleton, then some other, <abbr title="PHP and mySQL joined the party yesterday, for example.">undetermined resources</abbr> to create the rest. <p>
  
  <h1> Hey! What if I keep this as a diary as I create this stuff?! Genius! :D </h1>
  
  <p> Hopefully, this will help to keep me engaged. Yeah, I can document everything happening while I do this stuff. It will make the project more interesting. </p>

  <h1 class="day"> Day One. 3/5/2016 </h1>
  
 <div id="dayOnePartOne">
  
  <p> We sneak a break in here <br> And this line should be on a new line. </p>
  
  <h2> IDEA! </h2>
  
  <p> How hard would it be to create a checklist to help me keep track of which tags I have used on <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_byfunc.asp">w3schools</a> as I use them, I wonder! </p>
  
  <p> Let's see. </p>
 </div>
  
  <h3> I was distracted by this: </h3>
  
  <p class="focusOnMe"> Definition and Usage <br> The &#60;acronym&#62; tag is not supported in HTML5. Use the &#60;abbr&#62; tag instead. <br>

  The &#60;acronym&#62; tag defines an acronym. <br> An acronym must spell out another word. For example: NASA, ASAP, GUI. <br>

  Marking up acronyms can give useful information to browsers, translation systems and search-engines. </p>
  
  <p> I love this! I want to abuse it. :O :D </p>
  
 <div id="dayOnePartThree">
  
  <p> I'm trying to stick with throwing together a checklist but I want to do it quickly so that I an get back to html and javascript and css :(. </p>
  
  <p> My silly gut wants me to try it in PowerShell. Is that silly? I want to try it. </p>
  
  <p> I did some Googling and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKfSCSgdLJA" class="niceTypo" id="wowee">founds this</a> <a href ="https://www.simple-talk.com/sql/learn-sql-server/how-to-import-data-from-html-pages">great article about importing data from <abbr title="hypertext markup language, right?">HTML</abbr> pages</a>.
  
  <p> I think I'm making this too complicated. Let's try to just stick check boxes by everything on the page I'm using as my html tag reference. </p>
 </div>
 <div id="dayOnePartFour"> 
  <h1> 4:57 PM </h1>
  
  <p> Oh man, I think my computer is slower now that it is running on Windows 10. :( Yeah, I just updated my operating system to 10. Finally gave in to the annoying pop up I kept getting. </p>
  
  <p> I updated my operating system so that Windows PowerShell would let me use the commands I found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9053573/powershell-html-parsing-get-information-from-a-website"> here </a>.</p>
  
  <p> This should allow me to create a checklist to keep track of what I've used already! Yay! I hope I can do this quickly! </p>
 </div>
  <hr> 
  
  <h1 class="day" id="philosophyAndTeaDayPizzaOverdose"> Day Two. 3/6/2016 </h1>
  
  <p> It took me all day yesterday to figure out how to scrape the silly tags and their description from that website. I feel eehhh okay about that. &#60;.&#62; </p>
  
  <p> WOO! It's 1:43 PM now and it hasn't been a completely unproductive day. I was able to find all of the commands I was able to use in order to scrape and format the information from that site and spit it into a text file to be copied, pasted, and manually fixed a little bit (added some missing stuff :/). Yay! <br>

    I am also experimenting right now with the br tag in this p. We'll see what happens later! I'm almost done(?) with this checklist so that I can focus on this experiment.  </p>
	
  <p> Oh, and I'm really enjoying some philosophy videos and tea today. Revisiting some Alain de Botton and discovered a couple new things that I hope I can find again later. </p>	
  
  <p> Second or third day in a row now (can't 'member anymore) that I have hurt myself with pizza. Looking forward to the first run in a week later AFTER THIS CHECKLIST! I got scared earlier <br>
    (last night) by something I read online about security and PHP and stuff but I think it actually probably isn't a super big deal for this since it's just checkboxes, right? Phew! Yay! </p>
	
  <hr>
  
  <h1 class="day"> Day Three. 3/7/2016 </h1>
  
  <p> Yeah, not <i>lovin'</i> Windows 10. </p>
  
  <h2> I accidentally lied about the amount of pizza I've eaten recently. </h2>
  
  <p> I got excited recounting my pizza stories from the past week this morning and exaggerated a little bit. I didn't realize my mistake until later. I'm so embarrassed(sp?). </p>
  
  <p> Oh, right, and, as for this project, needless to say, nothing has happened on this yet today. Work and dance, you know. I am considering splitting up the checklist and the html/diary/actual experiment portion of this document that I have been working in. They were separate until yesterday, when I thought it made sense to combine them. This happened right before I started <abbr title="drown">down</abbr> the mySQL path that I started down yesterday. What an eventful Sunday! </p>
  
  <p> I guess we'll know pretty soon whether or not I decide to split them up. </p> 
  
  <h2> 10:45 PM - 1:33 AM </h2>
  
  <p> Oh man, guys, I was freshly motivated by the sight of this boring, undressed thing in Chrome a little while ago! Awwww!!!! I found and used this <a href="http://www.theukwebdesigncompany.com/articles/entity-escape-characters.php">fantastic site with HTML escape characters</a>, too! </p>
  
  <p> I am going to simultaneously trash and beautify this bad boy tonight. I picked a handful of photos from some of my old iPhone photo dumps to shoehorn in, too, then accidentally lost those photos by accidentally closing a photo window, then spent a long time looking for all of my blurry photos; the inspiration to do this hit me while I was trying to find the first set of photos over again and realized that I have collected quite a few blurry photos over the years. </p>
  
  <hr>
  
  <h1 class="day"> Day Four. 3/8/2016 </h1>
  
  <p> It occurred to me, as I began to type this day four entry, that there is probably a way to use the new "day" class that I just created tonight to store or point to some function that increments the day count for me. Hmmm should think on this, try to remember, do some Googling if necessary, and try to make this happen as soon as possible! <br>
      also, I'm kind of bummed and a little nervous. According to the stuff I'm reading at http://www.htmlgoodies.com/html5/client/how-to-embed-video-using-html5.html#fbid=uzcv2Kdye0Z and based on the failure of all of my attempts tonight to lazily, clumsily, blindly try to convince a background image to transform into a video have failed, I will most likely use the HTML solution described on the site.<br>
      The end result won't be as pretty as this looked in my head but at least it's possible given what I know today (hopefully)!</p>   
  
  <p> It is almost 3 AM. I should go to sleep now. :s </p>
  
    <hr>
  
  <h1 class="day"> Day Five and into Six. 3/8&9/2016 </h1>
  
  <p> Ffffffuuuu- it's almost over! The day is almost over, it is 10:30 PM, and I am only just now sitting down to look at this today. I don't think I'll try to load back up into my brain what I was working on last night before I went to sleep (yeah yeah, whatever, early, early this morning). What I <i>will</i> do right now is take another look at this unfinished thing in the browser. :D  </p>
       
  <p> Ufff, well, it is 12:04 AM and I think I just realized why I'm getting this "Not allowed to load local resource: file:///C:/...blah blah.jpg (blah) | error, security) </p>
  
  <p> I am so glad I opted to save the link to those escape characters here the other night! Yay! Compulsive data collection pays off tonight! </p>
  
  <p class="ramble"> Since I'm already sitting here in from of the laptop, bein' all productive and feelin' good, I'll go ahead and mention this upsetting little pain in the inside of my knee. I <em>guess</em> I could have possibly pulled something during my run the other day? I feel like fear of the pain is making me walk funny, mostly in the form of distributing my weight unnaturally on my feet when I am standing), which maybe now is <em><i>contributing</i></em>. Ay, yeah, I think I must have pulled something in the inner knee area or something. Strained, maybe? Please don't let it be nasty or irreversible damage! <br>
  
  it is also possible that I have just worked out too hard recently. smuuuuug faaaaaace yaaaaaaaas i am dreaming of a big breakfast </p>
  
  <p> Oh! I can hear a storm outside. Oh myyyyy I almost forgot to mention that I learned that two of my coworkers speak Yoruba! Aaahhh!!! I need to try to find that Yoruba guide in portuguese that I found last year. Oh man </p>
  
  <p class='intrusiveThoughts'> the oil i put on my skin really irritates my eyes! my eyes are irritated right now. Oh man, I discovered this show that I'm watching <i>as we speak</i> with Adam Beach(sp?) from the earlier 2000s (maybe 2002?) that is about a cop or detective that moves back to the Navajo reservation to become a healer? I'm not sure exactly what the plot is but I enjoy seeing Native Americans at all in a TV show. There are only three of these episodes on Netflix. </p>
  
  <p class="censorMe"> Oh myyyy I had to turn the computer back on to add a couple of things here tonight before I forget! <br>
  
  <ul><li>I can create a censor class and put pretty much whatever I want. Yay!</li>
  <li>I felt like there was a very Native quality to this show I'm watching tonight but then I worried I was somehow being racist? Well, get this! Chris Eyre directed this episode I'm watching right now?!?!?! :O Also, I didn't mention this earlier but there are at least two other Native actors in this show that I recognize. :p NOICE! Good job, Netflix!</li>
  <li>I think I just made a flamenco braceo/floreo breakthrough! Ole!</li>
  <li>I can now flex parts of my back and torso that I had never considered really trying to flex before. AAAHH!!!</li>
  <li>I am still making progress with figuring out how to improve my posture. Yay!</li>
  <li>I have a reliable workaround for the bug I have discovered involving the biometric finger scanner not working when I try to log in. The fix that seems to work consistently is to instesad log into the work account, log out, then, the scanner starts blinking and responding again! Man, I should probably start looking for a new computer. It's 1:32 AM okay good night!</ul>

  <ol> 
      <li>What a day! Got the cleaning person's name today. Freddy! He was listening to that cumbia Llorar!</li>
      <li>Oh, yeah, I just had to re-learn how to use the unordered list tag.</li>
      <li>Got both the name and the number of our security guy. Not as interesting as it sounds! Nice guy, just not sure we have enough in common that we should hang out? I'll try anything once. We'll see what happens. Yeah, I'll probably never text. </li>
      <li>Man, it's too easy to get distracted or tired! I will probably never truly finish any of these entries. Weird.</li>

   <p>I am typing this down quickly so I don't forget. sorry for the mess, future lisa!<br>
  
       I just got sucked into that video of the president getting torchy's tacos on facebook again. I'm back on facebook on m'pc for the first time in I don' tknow how many months or years and there's that feature that allows the videos you post to silently play, and that's how it happened that I watched it again just now. I realized almost at the end just how captivating Obama is! The sound is distracting. If you watch the video silently, you can focus more on his body language and it's amazing. Oh, my god, he just looks <i>so calm and cool</i>. It made me think of those two videos I love so much, the one with Fred Armisen's Cool Obama impression and the documentary on youtube about body language that studies the body language of people in the news. Maaaan, Obama's body language. Sublime! Effective! Soothing! Wow! You can't help but think of how much it contrasts with the body language of many people we see today. Just watch for it. Watch for the differences in how they move and hold themselves and interact with individuals, and their eyes. Wow.<br>

  I realized that 3 libras might be a waltz yesterday. Need to do more research to confirm but WOW<br>

  <p>Oh man, just spent a good chunk of time on facebook on my laptop again. Digging up old photos of Grandma, forgot to get other family photos for art project I thought of, just ended up looking at all of my profile(?) pictures. I have lead a sufficiently interesting life so far, I think, and it's not been so bad. This is just one of those days I'm gonna mostly blow just thinkin', philosiphizin', and thinking of more project ideas. :P

          and moving the photos to the same dir that the rest of this project lives. seems so obvious now, of course. doi!</p>  
      <hr>
      <p>made my own font with my new Birdfont program I downloaded. making a font is hard, plus, Windows 10, of course, doesn't allow you to install<br>
          your own font so I am just using CSS to use my own ttf file. So silly!<br>
          Now, I have to remake my font if I want to be able to use it for this; it looks terrible and is not yet legible.
